Simulink Block Slice to Graph Embeddings & Classification üß†üåê
Overview
This project takes backward slices of Simulink blocks, transforms each slice into a directed network graph using networkx, and generates embeddings for each graph using the Graph2Vec model. These graph embeddings are then used as features for a Random Forest classifier to perform binary classification.

Project Workflow:
Backward Slice Extraction: Slice data is loaded from JSON and transformed into a connected networkx graph.
Graph Embedding: Graph2Vec is used to generate embeddings from each graph.
Binary Classification: The embeddings are used to train a Random Forest classifier, with options for resampling using SMOTE to handle imbalanced data.
üìÅ Project Structure:
/src/: Core logic for the project, including graph extraction, embedding generation, and classification.
/examples/: Example synthetic data and scripts showcasing how to run the project.
/data/: Directory for storing your actual data (not included for confidentiality).
/models/: Directory for storing trained models (optional).
requirements.txt: List of required Python libraries.
üöÄ Features:
Graph Generation: Converts block slices into directed graphs with attributes.
Graph Embedding: Uses Graph2Vec to create high-dimensional vector representations of graphs.
Binary Classification: Random Forest classifier for binary classification with SMOTE to balance class distribution.
‚öôÔ∏è How to Use:
1. Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simulink-graph2vec-classifier.git
cd simulink-graph2vec-classifier
2. Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, then install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Example:
Run the example script with synthetic data provided in the examples/ folder:

bash
Copy code
python examples/example.py
4. Run with Your Own Data:
To run the project with your own data, replace the synthetic JSON file in the /data/ directory with your data:

bash
Copy code
# Replace /data/your_data.json with your file
python src/main.py --input /data/your_data.json --output /models/trained_model.pkl
üîç Detailed Workflow:
Graph Extraction: Each backward slice from Simulink is converted into a directed graph where nodes represent blocks and edges represent data flow between them.

Graph Embedding: Graph2Vec generates vector embeddings of the graphs that capture their structural features.

Classification: A Random Forest classifier is trained on the embeddings. The model can predict labels for new graphs based on the learned features.

üìä Example Results:
Using synthetic data, the model achieves:

Precision: 0.85
Recall: 0.80
F1 Score: 0.82
ROC AUC: 0.88
‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:
Confidential Data: The real data used in this project is confidential and not included in this repository. To run the project, users should provide their own data in the correct format.
SMOTE Handling: The classifier uses SMOTE to handle class imbalance. This can be adjusted based on your dataset.
